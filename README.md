# Arduino Projects Repository

Welcome to my Arduino Projects repository! This collection showcases various Arduino-based projects that I've developed during my studies. Each project is an example of hands-on experience gained in electronics, programming, and embedded systems. Feel free to explore, use, and modify these projects for your learning or personal use.

## Project List

Below is a list of the projects included in this repository:

- **Button.ino**: A simple program demonstrating the use of a push button.
- **countdownWithBuzzer.ino**: A countdown timer that uses a buzzer to alert when time is up.
- **DiodeSteering.ino**: Basic steering of LEDs with diodes to show direction control.
- **HumidityPlusTempOnLCD.ino**: Measures and displays humidity and temperature on an LCD.
- **InfraredSignalReceiver.ino**: A project to receive and decode infrared signals from a remote control.
- **laser rangefinder.ino**: A laser-based distance measurement tool.
- **LCDinit.ino**: Basic initialization and testing of an LCD screen.
- **MotionSensorWithBuzzer.ino**: A motion sensor that triggers a buzzer when movement is detected.
- **OLEDPlusButtonGame.ino**: A simple game using an OLED display and a button interface.
- **safeWithBluetooth.ino**: A secure safe that uses Bluetooth for access control.
- **SnakeWithBuzzer.ino**: A basic snake game implemented with a buzzer for sound effects.
- **thermometer.ino**: A basic digital thermometer using temperature sensors.
- **ThermometerWithLCD.ino**: An enhanced digital thermometer with an LCD display.
- **traffic lights.ino**: Simulation of a traffic light system using LEDs.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of these projects, you'll need an Arduino board, the necessary components, and the Arduino IDE installed on your computer.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/arduino-projects.git
   ```

2. Open the .ino file in the Arduino IDE.

3. Connect your Arduino board, upload the sketch, and enjoy the project!
